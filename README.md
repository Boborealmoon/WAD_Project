## About The Project

Welcome to EatWise, a revolutionary solution addressing the pressing challenges faced by individuals in our community. Many people struggle with inadequate food and health literacy, often exacerbated by limited financial resources. This unfortunate reality not only impacts their overall well-being but also hampers their ability to make informed choices about their diet and nutrition.

EatWise is a comprehensive and empathetic initiative designed to bridge the gap between limited resources and optimal health. Our mission is simple: to improve access to nutritious food, enhance health education, and alleviate financial constraints. By providing a holistic platform, EatWise empowers individuals to take charge of their well-being, fostering a healthier, happier, and more informed community.
